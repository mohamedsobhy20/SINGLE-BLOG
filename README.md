# Project Comments

### General
* commits messages should be a summery description of what these edits about, not just any random message with some dates.
* File structure needs to be more organized

### SASS
* `.sass-cache` directory/folder shouldn't be included in the repo as it's just for development env purposes which mean it won't be included in the production or uploaded to the live websit.
* Avoid deep nesting it's not the main feature/useful thing in SASS, also read articles about SASS best practices like thes two articles > [CSS-Tricks: Sass Style Guide](https://css-tricks.com/sass-style-guide/) & [8 Tips to Help You Get the Best out of Sass](https://www.sitepoint.com/8-tips-help-get-best-sass/) you don't have to follow each point to the letter, it all depends on your needs in the project.
* No need for old CSS then to include it in the project.
